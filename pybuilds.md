## Instructions:

#### For Windows 10 / MacOS

For Windows 10 and Mac, you need to have Python3 installed.
You can either install the latest python version for [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or [MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).

Before clicking install, click **`Add Python 3.X to Path`**. This will allow the `pip` command to work.

After it is completely installed, open the terminal and type:
```bash
pip install easygui
```

You can now run the file.
